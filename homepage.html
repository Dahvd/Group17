<!--
(main social network page).
The homepage must look professional and include all different components of the social network that you have in mind, 
and include links to other pages youâ€™ll add in the future.
- Who to follow, trending hashtags, link to messages, link to profile
The page must be populated with static dummy data for the sake of presentation
For example, a few posts by different users, etc.
You can choose to make your social network look similar to Facebook or Twitter Web apps (not Mobile apps) and build a similar homepage to those.
