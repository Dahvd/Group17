# Homepage Description
The homepage contains a navigation bar that has a fixed position to the top of the page.  The navigation bar includes the logo which links back to the homepage, a search bar, another home page button, a notifications dropdown, a messages tab, a trending posts tab, and an account dropdown which has options to access the users profile, settings, or the help page.

The main content of the page has three columns.

The left column is fixed in position and does not move when the page is scrolled.  This column has a suggested followers tab with people the user may choose to follow.

The middle column is where all of the posts are organized. Each post contains a title which shows the poster and their profile picture.  Below the poster information, is the body of the post where the poster expresses their thoughts.  If an image is attached, below the text body of the post is where it will be seen.  

The right column for now contains ads which may be removed or moved elsewhere should any other content related information be thought of.
