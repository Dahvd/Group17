# Sign Up Description

The sign up page contains one main div element and one form elemement.

The first div element contains the image that we are using for our social media page and
a header that simply says 'Create SocNet Account'.

The form contains 8 div elements. First name, last name, @ username, gender, location,
email, and a password/confirm password field. Most fields use inputs as the way of
collecting the user information; the only field that does not is the gender field which
uses a select element and displays a dropdown. All fields are required other than the
gender and location field.

There is also a sign up button to submit information and the cancel button which clears the form.

Last, we have a footer that conatins Copyright @ 2021 SocNet.

# Sign In Description

The sign in page is made of various div elements and one form element.

The first div element contains the image that we are using for our social media page and
a header that simply says 'Sign in to SocNet'.

The form contains two input elements which ask the user for their accounts email and password; both fields are required.

Under these two input fields we have a checkbox to allow the user to remember the account and not have to login again followed by two buttons; cancel and sign in. Sign in submits the information while the cancel clears it.

Right outside the form we have references to the forgot password page and sign up page.

Last, we have a footer that conatins Copyright @ 2021 SocNet.

# Homepage Description

The homepage contains a navigation bar that has a fixed position to the top of the page. The navigation bar includes the logo which links back to the homepage, a search bar, another home page button, a notifications dropdown, a messages tab, a trending posts tab, and an account dropdown which has options to access the users profile, settings, or the help page.

The main content of the page has three columns.

The left column is fixed in position and does not move when the page is scrolled. This column has a suggested followers tab with people the user may choose to follow.

The middle column is where all of the posts are organized. Each post contains a title which shows the poster and their profile picture. Below the poster information, is the body of the post where the poster expresses their thoughts. If an image is attached, below the text body of the post is where it will be seen.

The right column for now contains ads which may be removed or moved elsewhere should any other content related information be thought of.
